sudo systemctl start redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
redis-cli ping  # To check if Redis replies with PONG

sudo systemctl status redis-server
(Above command checks if redis is running or not)

sudo service redis-server restart
(doing the above worked-worked means redis-cli ping must return pong)
